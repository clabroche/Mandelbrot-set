# Mandelbrot set

The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers c for which the function fc(z)=z2+c does not diverge when iterated from z=0, i.e., for which the sequence fc(0),fc(fc(0)), etc., remains bounded in absolute value.

All the values ​​of the mandelbrot set represented in a reference are called fractals. Indeed, the same form is repeated infinitely towards the infinite small:
